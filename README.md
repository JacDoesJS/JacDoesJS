- 👋 Hi, I’m @JacDoesJS, and I started learning to code seriously in January 2022 and I absolutely love it!
- 👀 For over 17 years, I've enjoyed a music portfolio career as violinist, teacher, composer (PhD), and conductor.
- 🌱 I’m a trainee software engineer enthusiastically learning as much as possible about JavaScript, Java, HTML & CSS (and PHP in my spare time)


##              "Am I testing my code, or is it testing me?"

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other newish / intermediate coders.
