### 👋 Hi, I’m Dr Jac and I love organisation in code, music, and weaving.
### 👀 For over 17 years, I've enjoyed a music portfolio career as violinist, teacher, composer (PhD), and conductor.
### 🌱 I’m an Associate Software Engineer enjoying working with and learning as much as possible about, Typescript, React, React Native, React Hook Form, Zod, HTML, Sass, CSS, Tailwind, Node.js, Next.js, Axios, Koa Router, Java, Spring Boot, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, DynamoDB, PostgresSQL, Swagger, Postman, ESLint, Husky. 
### Update August 2024: now learning Python which rather than being the difficult third album is the pleasurable third language :-)
### In my current role I am a committed accessibility ally.
### In my spare time I walk, weave, make music, and enjoy Scottish dancing.

#### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other coders of any level.
