### 👋 Hi, I’m Dr Jac and I love organisation in code, music, and weaving.
### 👀 Front-end Developer, Accessibilty Advocate, and general encourager of communication, whether that's better documentation, more useful error messages, or just ditching the acronyms.
### 🎻 For over 17 years, I enjoyed a music portfolio career as violinist, teacher, composer (PhD), and conductor.
### 🌱 I enjoy working with and learning about, Javascript, Typescript, React, React Native, Python, HTML, SCSS, CSS, Tailwind, Node.js, Next.js, Java, Spring Boot, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes. 

### In my spare time I walk, weave, make music, enjoy Scottish dancing - and write more code.

#          "Am I testing my code, or is it testing me?"
<br>

#### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other coders of any level.
